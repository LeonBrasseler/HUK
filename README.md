Trained a GLM model and a simple NN model to calculate the claim amount per year based on the provided input features.

# Train
Runs both models after each other and prints their MAE

# glm.py
Trains a GLM model to predict the claim amount per year based on the provided input features.

# nn.py
Trains a simple NN model to predict the claim amount per year based on the provided input features.

# data_load.py
